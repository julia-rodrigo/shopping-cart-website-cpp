/*

THIS IS THE INSTRUCTION SHEET

You need to connect to a server with this app.
I used nginx server, you can find the nginx.configuration 
in 'nginx.cpp' in 'Resource Files'.

Navigate to 'C:\nginx' in folder directory and start 
server by clicking on the application called 'nginx' 
with the nginx icon

Navigate to 'C:\nginx' directory in terminal and run: 
{
	> nginx -s reload
}

With this, you should have nginx server
running on the browser on:

        localhost:8080


Next run this project on Visual Studio 2022. 
(dont forget to have the boost/asio library installed in your pc
And dont forget to configure the app directory)

When the project runs successfully you can reload nginx page 
and see the table. 

Enter contents on the table and the 'cart.json' in 'Source Files' 
will update respectfully
